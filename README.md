# taxi_tip_prediction

I have created my first repository with this model. In this case, I have worked with the public data set of Taxis of New York and I'm going to predict the tip amount of each trip

The link of the data set is the next one:

But I have just download three sets: march, june and november in 2017. And the main of this project is suggesting a tip amount to the rider. This model should predict the likely tip amount for a trip based on the other trip attributes.
